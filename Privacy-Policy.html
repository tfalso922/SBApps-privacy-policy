## Introduction

Speech Tally ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Speech Tally handles information when you use our iOS application.

## Information We Do Not Collect

Speech Tally is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to make this absolutely clear:

**WE DO NOT COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR DATA FROM YOU.**

Specifically, we do not:
- Collect any personal information
- Track your usage or behavior
- Collect analytics or statistics
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Require you to create an account
- Request access to your contacts, photos, location, or any other personal data
- Share any information with third parties
- Store any data on remote servers

## Data Storage

All data you enter into Speech Tally (such as client names, tally counts, and percentages) is:
- Stored locally on your device only
- Never transmitted to any external servers
- Never backed up to our servers (only to your own iCloud if you enable device backup)
- Completely under your control

If you delete the app, all associated data is deleted from your device.

## Third-Party Services

Speech Tally does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

Speech Tally does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is designed for use by professionals (Speech-Language Pathologists) but does not collect information from the professional or their clients.

## HIPAA Compliance Note

While Speech Tally does not collect or transmit any data, please note:
- If you enter protected health information (PHI) such as client names, this data remains on your device
- You are responsible for ensuring your use of the app complies with HIPAA and other applicable regulations
- We recommend using client initials or identification numbers rather than full names
- Ensure your device is password-protected and encrypted
- Follow your organization's policies regarding mobile device use

## California Privacy Rights

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we want to be transparent:
- We do not sell personal information
- We do not collect personal information to sell or share
- There is no personal information to request, delete, or opt out of

## International Users

Speech Tally operates the same way regardless of your location. No data is collected from users in any country.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Since we don't collect any information, changes to this policy are unlikely to affect your privacy rights.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data:
- There is no data to request access to
- There is no data to request deletion of
- There is no data to opt out of collection or sharing

All data in the app is already completely under your control on your device.
